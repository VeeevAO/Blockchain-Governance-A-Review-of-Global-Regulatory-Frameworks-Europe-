#### Blockchain Governance: A Review of Global Regulatory Frameworks (Europe)

Introduction

Europe’s cryptocurrency regulations extend beyond the borders of the European Union (EU). This article examines 46 countries (the 44 UN members in Europe, plus Kosovo and the Vatican City) to illustrate how the region regulates blockchain in practice. Within the EU, frameworks such as the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), the Travel Rule, and various other Directives and Guidelines create a harmonised regulatory environment. Some EU member states even went a step further to introduce criminal sanctions to bolster compliance.

In contrast, significant markets like the UK and Switzerland, along with numerous European Economic Area (EEA) states, neighbouring countries, and microstates, operate under distinct regulatory frameworks, each with unique timelines, permissions, and enforcement styles. As the second part of this series, this article builds on the North America article, employing the same template (laws, guidelines, licensing, cases, enforcement). This structure allows for a direct comparison of jurisdictions, facilitating informed planning for any cross-border or inter-jurisdictional activities.

- The European Union (EU)

- The [Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1114/oj) (MiCA) 2023/1114 establishes uniform rules for crypto-assets and related services and activities within the EU. Some provisions of MiCA include definitions for essential terms and concepts, such as the scope of what is a “crypto-asset service”, mandates Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) to be authorised before operating (Title V stipulates the grounds for authorisation and withdrawal, and conditions of operating), specifies rules for crypto-asset White Paper, Consumer Protection, and Stable Coins (referred to as asset-referenced & electronic money tokens. The Regulation does not apply to crypto-assets that are unique and not fungible with other crypto-assets, such as digital art and collectibles.

- [Regulation (EU) 2023/1113](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32023R1113) (Transfer of Funds Regulation - TFR), also known as the “Travel Rule”, amends [Directive (EU) 2015/849](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2015/849/oj/eng)[The Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism EU Directive (AML/CFT)], expands the rules governing the transfer of funds to include crypto-assets and requires the inclusion of payer/payee or originator/beneficiary details during transfer of funds or crypto-assets. Chapter III of the Regulation outlines all obligations that CASPs must follow during the transfer transactions.

- European Banking Authority (EBA) Guidelines

- [EBA/GL/2024/11](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-07/6de6e9b9-0ed9-49cd-985d-c0834b5b4356/Travel%20Rule%20Guidelines.pdf), also known as the “Travel Rule Guidelines,” clarifies the steps Payment Service Providers (PSPs), CASPs, and their Intermediaries should take to detect missing or incomplete information that accompanies a transfer of funds or crypto-assets, and the procedures they should put in place to manage a situation where a transfer is lacking the required information.

- [EBA/GL/2024/01](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/a3e89f4f-fbf3-4bd6-9e07-35f3243555b3/Final%20Amending%20%20Guidelines%20on%20MLTF%20Risk%20Factors.pdf) amends ML/TF Risk-Factors Guidelines ([EBA/GL/2021/02](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Guidelines/2021/963637/Final%20Report%20on%20Guidelines%20on%20revised%20ML%20TF%20Risk%20Factors.pdf)), extending the AML risk-factor guidelines to crypto-assets and CASPs. It also introduces crypto-specific risk factors and measures to combat them, such as CASPs having suitable and effective transaction monitoring and analytical tools, as well as applying enhanced customer due diligence (CDD).

- The Directive on Administrative Cooperation ([DAC8](https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/taxation/tax-transparency-cooperation/administrative-co-operation-and-mutual-assistance/directive-administrative-cooperation-dac/dac8_en)) is an [EU Council Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023L2226) based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework ([OECD-CARF](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/tax-transparency-and-international-co-operation.html)). It mandates the automatic exchange of information on crypto-assets between EU countries to combat tax fraud, evasion, and avoidance. Reporting CryptoAsset Service Providers (RCASPs) are also subject to reporting requirements and due diligence procedures. This Directive will become applicable across all EU Countries by 1 January 2026.

- [Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/299](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2025/299/oj/eng) of 31 October 2024 supplements the EU MiCA, setting regulatory technical standards requiring crypto-asset service providers to keep proportionate, management-approved, and annually tested business-continuity policies and plans—covering governance, timely client/authority communications, etc., to ensure continuity and regularity of services.

- [The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) Guidelines (2025)](https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica) cover the following key areas:

- Maintaining secure systems and access controls for crypto-services.

- Establishing rules for crypto-asset transfer services.

- Clarifying reverse solicitation from third-country firms.

- Defining suitability and periodic statement requirements for portfolio management.

- Guiding the prevention and detection of crypto market abuse.

- Establishing minimum knowledge and competence standards for staff.

- Regulation 2022/858 of 30 May 2022 ([the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2022.151.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ%3AL%3A2022%3A151%3ATOC)) establishes a time-limited EU pilot for market infrastructures based on distributed ledger technology (DLT), which includes DLT multilateral trading facilities, DLT settlement systems, and combined DLT trading and settlement systems. These infrastructures can trade and settle tokenised financial instruments under the oversight of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). The pilot allows for targeted, conditional exemptions from several regulations, including the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR, Regulation (EU) No 600/2014), the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II, Directive 2014/65/EU), and the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR, Regulation (EU) No 909/2014). Eligibility is limited to shares of issuers with a market capitalisation under €500 million, bonds and money-market instruments with issue sizes under €1 billion, and units in collective investment undertakings with assets under management under €500 million. Additionally, there is an aggregate cap of €6 billion per infrastructure and a €9 billion threshold that triggers transition off the pilot.

- Albania

- [Law No. 66/2020](https://amf.gov.al/pdf/ligje/LawNo_66_2020ONFINANCIALMARKETSBASEDONDISTRIBUTEDLEDGERTECHNOLOGY.pdf?), enacted in 2020, is Albania’s first regulation governing cryptocurrencies. It governs financial market activities based on distributed ledger technology (DLT), requires Virtual Assets Service Providers (VASPs) to obtain a license before operating, and mandates compliance with all Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations. The Albanian Financial Supervisory Authority (AFSA) and the National Authority on Information Society (NAIS) are responsible for administration. The [AFSA](https://amf.gov.al/licencimi_rregullimi.asp) provides the procedures for obtaining a licence.

- Notable case: In 2022, [two crypto mining farms](https://asp.gov.al/policia-e-shtetit-finalizohet-operacioni-policor-i-koduar-kriptofarm/) were shut down, and the perpetrators were arrested for failing to comply with provisions of the law.

- Decrees [211/2023](https://bopadocuments.blob.core.windows.net/bopa-documents/035065/pdf/GR20230515_08_58_08.pdf) & [213/2023](https://bopadocuments.blob.core.windows.net/bopa-documents/035065/pdf/GR20230515_08_59_57.pdf) were both issued in May 2023 and form part of the government of Andorra’s strategy to promote digital innovation and the digital economy. They promote fintech research and development through a controlled testing environment known as a “sandbox” and establish the framework for registering and operating innovative start-ups.

- [Digital Assets Act](https://www.portaljuridicandorra.ad/L2022024) (Law 24/2022) recognises blockchain and digital assets, granting them legal value in the form of cryptocurrency. It requires VASPs to be licensed and implement AML/CFT obligations, including the traceability of transactions and the maintenance of records for 10 years. The overseeing authority is the Andorran Financial Authority.

- [Decree 478/2022](https://bopadocuments.blob.core.windows.net/bopa-documents/034139/pdf/GD20221125_08_49_08.pdf) establishes the regulatory framework for licensing and supervising persons dealing with digital assets and distributed ledger technology (DLT) Exchanges. It mandates all entities in the digital assets space to comply with all AML/CFT policies.

- [Law 9/2021](https://www.portaljuridicandorra.ad/L2021009) amends [Law 35/2014](https://bopadocuments.blob.core.windows.net/bopa-documents/026071/pdf/lo26071011.pdf) on electronic trust services to include trust services on the DLT.

It defines CASPs and subjects them to the same AML/CFT obligations as other financial institutions. The Securities and Exchange Commission maintains an [official register](https://www.cysec.gov.cy/en-GB/entities/crypto-asset-services-providers-casps/casp-register/) of CASPs under this law. This register lists entities that are legally authorised to offer crypto-asset services in or from Cyprus.

Meanwhile, [a new crypto-asset taxation law](https://skm.dk/aktuelt/presse-nyheder/nyheder/lovforslag-om-beskatning-af-kryptoaktiver-udskydes) is being proposed, which will clarify the tax rules. Recommendations published by the Tax Council in an October 2024 [Report](https://skm.dk/ministeriet/om-skatteministeriet/publikationer-fra-skattelovraadet/rapport-om-finansielle-kryptoaktiver) are proposed to be the basis for this new law.

- Notable cases: [Cases BS-32180/2021-HJR & BS-17439/2022-HJR](https://www.domstol.dk/hoejesteret/aktuelt/2023/3/beskatning-af-fortjeneste-ved-salg-af-bitcoins/), in both cases, the court held that profits from cryptocurrency mining and subsequent sales are subject to taxation, regardless of acquisition method (purchase, mining, or donation), subject to narrow speculation exemptions.

- Estonia (EU Member)

- [Market in Crypto-Assets Act (2024)](https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/519092024001/consolide?) implements the EU MiCA and Digital Operations Resilience Act ([DORA](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2022/2554/oj/eng)) in Estonia’s national law. Finantsinspektsioon (Financial Supervisory Authority) is the designated supervisory authority.

- [Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act (2017)](https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/517112017003/consolide) subjects VASPs to AML/CFT obligations. It provided the framework for licensing of VASPs in Estonia before the EU MiCA and granted supervisory and licensing authority to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). The [FIU has published several guidelines](https://fiu.ee/en/guidelines-fiu/guidelines?) on virtual asset-related activities.

- Notable case: [B2BX Digital Exchange OÜ](https://fiu.ee/en/news/b2bx-digital-exchange-ou-renounced-their-license-virtual-asset-services-during-supervision?), facing licence revocation from the FIU after significant deficiencies were found in its operations, voluntarily relinquished its license on January 31, 2025.

- Finland (EU Member)

- [Bill No. T/11922](https://www.parlament.hu/irom42/11922/11922-0013.pdf) (June 2025) amends several Hungarian laws, including the [Criminal Code](https://net.jogtar.hu/jogszabaly?docid=a1200100.tv) (2012. évi C. törvény), to enhance the competitiveness of Hungary. These amendments criminalise the abuse of crypto-assets and the unauthorised provision of crypto-asset exchange services. Under the new legislation, users of unauthorised crypto exchanges—those that are not validated or licensed—who convert crypto-assets into fiat or other crypto-assets face penalties of 2 to 5 years imprisonment. Similarly, unauthorised service providers (CASPs) can be punished with imprisonment ranging from 3 to 8 years. The length of the prison sentence is determined by the financial threshold involved in the offence. For example, a basic offence involving any unauthorised crypto exchange, irrespective of the value, can result in up to 3 years in prison. In contrast, a very high-value offence involving amounts of HUF 500 million or more could lead to a maximum of 8 years imprisonment.

It defines crypto-assets, sets out the types of services that require authorisation, and delegates oversight to either the Minister of State or the Commission de Contrôle des Activités Financières (CCAF), depending on the service. In its 2024 amendment, the law introduced licensing exemptions for limited crypto activities, streamlined onboarding for already-authorised financial entities, expanded CCAF’s oversight to new crypto services like staking, added transitional provisions for existing providers, and aligned terminology with EU MiCA and FATF standards.

- [Law No. 1.559 of February 2024](http://legimonaco.mc/tnc/loi/2024/02-29-1.559@2024.03.02/) is the AML/CFT legal framework.

- [The Law of 11 December 2024](https://www.eerstekamer.nl/behandeling/20241217/publicatie_wet_5/document3/f=/vmj8ckj072z0.pdf) (Uitvoeringswet verordening cryptoactiva) amends the Financial Supervision Act and the Economic Offences Act to implement the EU MiCA into Dutch national law. Under this legislation, De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) and the Autoriteit Financiële Markten (AFM) are granted regulatory and supervisory responsibilities to prohibit or suspend the offering, trading, advertising, and distribution of crypto-assets, to require modifications of crypto-asset white papers, and impose immediate cessation of unauthorised crypto-asset activities. Additionally, the amendment made to the [Dutch Economic and Offences Act](https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0002063/2025-07-18) makes non-compliance with certain provisions (e.g. Articles 4, 16, 58, and 88) criminally enforceable.

Additionally, it stipulates that the transition period for currently registered providers ends on 30 June 2025, after which compliance with MiCA is mandatory.

- [AML/CFT Act (Wwft)](https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0024282/2025-07-01) has undergone several amendments. However, in 2020, the amendment included custodial wallet providers and crypto-fiat exchanges as obliged entities, necessitating their registration with DNB and compliance with AML provisions. The 2024 amendment aligned with the EU MiCA provisions; this amendment mandated that CASPs transmit identifying information of users during transfers and monitor, reject, or freeze transfers that lack the required data. In 2025, the amendment was further extended to encompass a wider array of crypto activities, including issuers, platforms, and exchanges. This amendment introduced several penalty categories, such as fines, suspensions, and bans, while also criminalising non-compliance under the Economic Offences Act.

It enforces AML obligations, bans anonymous crypto technologies (e.g., privacy coins), and establishes a €500 transaction threshold for full AML compliance. The 2024 amendment expanded obligations for corporate groups, mandating that all transfers over €500 include sender and recipient identities and transaction metadata (e.g., timestamp, hash). The registration process changed, allowing the FIU to verify physical presence before accepting registrations. VASPs must report synthetic transactions aimed at evading detection and any linked transfers between wallets of the same entity, even if conducted by separate VASPs.

- [Prop. 55 LS (2024-2025)](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/prop.-55-ls-20242025/id3090597/) – Lov om kryptoeiendeler (Kryptoeiendelsloven) transposes the EU MiCA into Norwegian national law, creating a comprehensive legal framework for the issuance, trading, and supervision of CASPs, effective from 1 July 2025. This framework includes licensing, investor protection measures, and market abuse prevention. The Finanstilsynet (Financial Supervisory Authority - FSA) will be granted supervisory authority, while the European Free Trade Association Surveillance Authority (EFTA Surveillance Authority - ESA) will oversee significant tokens, that is, crypto tokens that are larger or systemically important.

- [Prop. 54 LS (2024–2025)](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/prop.-54-ls-20242025/id3090648/) amends several Norwegian laws, including the Money Laundering Act, Financial Institutions Act, and Securities Trading Act, to incorporate the EU TFR and DORA into national legislation. This implementation mandates that CASPs collect and share sender and receiver data, adhere to stringent cybersecurity and operational standards, and operate under the oversight of Finanstilsynet, effective from 1 July 2025.

- [Prop. 91 L (2024–2025)](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/prop.-91-l-20242025/id3094399/?ch=1) incorporates the OECD’s CARF and amendments to the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) into Norwegian law. From 2026, it mandates tax reporting for crypto-asset service providers in Norway, requiring them to submit detailed user and transaction data in line with the OECD’s global CARF standard to combat tax evasion.

- [AML Act of 2018](https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2018-06-01-23) designated CASPs as obliged entities, subjecting them to AML/CFT obligations and requiring registration with Finanstilsynet. The [2024-2025 amendment](https://lovdata.no/dokument/LTI/lov/2025-06-20-47) fosters traceability and transparency in cryptocurrency transactions, along with compliance in the legal sector. Lawyers must conduct AML checks when assisting clients with financial transactions or in company formation activities. However, exemptions apply when lawyers are representing clients in court or assessing legal status.

- Notable case: In [February 2025](https://www.okokrim.no/omfattende-bedrageri-og-hvitvasking.6708431-549344.html?), Økokrim charged four men with defrauding investors of over NOK 900 million through a fake crypto scheme. Over NOK 700 million was laundered by concealing criminal proceeds and failing to report suspicious activity.

- Poland (EU Member)

- [The Crypto-Asset Market Act (2025)](https://www.gov.pl/web/premier/projekt-ustawy-o-rynku-kryptoaktywow?) establishes a comprehensive licensing and supervisory framework for crypto-asset service providers and token issuers under the oversight of the Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego (KNF - Financial Supervision Authority). This Act aligns national legislation with the EU's MiCA and TFR and introduces stringent rules concerning operations, client protection, reporting, and enforcement. Additionally, it amends several existing laws, including the AML Act, as well as the Civil and Penal Codes and the Tax Codes.

- Notable case: In June 2025, in exercise of its oversight functions, KNF approved the prospectus for the [Beta ETF Bitcoin Portfolio FIZ](https://www.knf.gov.pl/komunikacja/komunikaty?articleId=94245&p_id=18) submitted by Towarzystwo Funduszy Inwestycyjnych SA.

- [The AML Act of 2018](https://dziennikustaw.gov.pl/DU/2025/644?) was amended in 2021 to include VASPs as obligated entities, requiring registration in the Virtual Asset Service Provider Register and adherence to AML/CFT obligations. The 2023 amendment introduced stricter penalties for failing to register as a CASP, as well as administrative fines for AML violations, with oversight from the Head of Krajowa Administracja Skarbowej (KAS- National Revenue Administration). Future amendments in 2024 and 2025 aligned the law with the EU MiCA, requiring CASPs to verify sources of funds for high-risk transactions above specified thresholds and clarifying licensing and transitional periods, with joint supervision from KNF and KAS.

- [Published Tax Rules](https://www.knf.gov.pl/komunikacja/komunikaty?articleId=94245&p_id=18) by the Ministry of Finance guide how cryptocurrencies are taxed in Poland. For instance, a 19% income tax is charged on income obtained from the sale of virtual currencies, and a report must be submitted annually using Form PIT 38.

- Portugal (EU Member)

- The EU MiCA applies to Portugal as a member of the EU. However, there is currently no national implementing law in place. [The Bank of Portugal](https://www.bportugal.pt/comunicado/comunicado-do-banco-de-portugal-relativo-aplicacao-do-regulamento-europeu-sobre-o?) has indicated that, despite the MiCA regulation being legally effective, only existing and operational CASPs registered with it under [Law No. 83/2017](https://diariodarepublica.pt/dr/detalhe/lei/83-2017-108021178) and [Notice No. 3/2021](https://diariodarepublica.pt/dr/detalhe/aviso-banco-portugal/3-2021-162022046) as of 30 December 2024 may continue their activities during this transitional period. Furthermore, the bank is not yet accepting new authorisation applications under MiCA due to the national legal vacuum.

- [Law No. 83/2017](https://diariodarepublica.pt/dr/legislacao-consolidada/lei/2017-108024643) is Portugal's AML/CFT law. Amendments from Laws No. 58/2020 and 99-A/2021 require VASPs to register with the Bank of Portugal, implement AML/CFT measures (including KYC and reporting), and are subject to supervision. Non-compliance may result in sanctions, including fines and cancellation of registration.

- Notable case: In 2021, the [Lisbon Court of Appeal](https://www.dgsi.pt/jtrl.nsf/33182fc732316039802565fa00497eec/e031c6fde689e6aa8025876d004fc2d8?OpenDocument=&) upheld the suspension of RC, Lda.'s bank accounts due to suspicions of money laundering and tax fraud, resulting in a freeze on all account activity by authorities under the AML Law.

- [Bank of Portugal Notice No. 1/2023](https://diariodarepublica.pt/dr/detalhe/aviso-banco-portugal/1-2023-206463782) provides detailed rules on how registered VASPs are to fulfil the AML/CTF obligations, including governance (must have a compliance officer), risk monitoring (use of analytical tools and data systems), transaction analysis, and reporting duties.

- [Draft Ordinance (May 2025)](https://mfinante.gov.ro/static/10/Mfp/transparenta/NFproiectOUGMICA_23052025.pdf) implements the EU MiCA in Romania, designating the Financial Supervisory Authority (Autoritatea de Supraveghere Financiară – ASF) and the National Bank of Romania (Banca Națională a României – BNR) as competent authorities, establishing licensing rules for crypto-asset service providers (including those operating cryptocurrency automated teller machines), setting technical and security requirements, defining sanctions for non-compliance, and introducing a 0.5% supervisory fee on monthly revenues from crypto-related activities.

- [AML/CFT law, Law No. 129 of 2019](https://legislatie.just.ro/Public/DetaliiDocumentAfis/294568) (amended in 2025), includes several important provisions. The 2020 amendment officially recognised VASPs and digital wallet providers as obliged entities, requiring them to comply with all AML/CFT regulations and to register appropriately before commencing operations. Further amendments made between [2021 and 2025 aimed to simplify registration obligations](https://mfinante.gov.ro/static/10/Mfp/transparenta/proiecthotcripto_11052023.pdf?), facilitate electronic submission of beneficial owner declarations, implement enhanced due diligence for high-risk cases, and align the law with the EU MiCA.

- [PROCEDURA 05/06/2025](https://legislatie.just.ro/Public/DetaliiDocument/299281?) establishes a de minimis aid scheme for SMEs aimed at promoting green and digital investments. Notably, this scheme excludes cryptocurrency mining and storage systems from eligibility. Additionally, [HOTĂRÂREA No. 25 (23/06/2025)](https://legislatie.just.ro/public/DetaliiDocument/299203?) extends taxation on cryptocurrency profits, integrates crypto into anti-evasion efforts, and introduces broader fiscal reforms designed to enhance transparency and compliance.

- [DECIZIA nr. 34/2021](https://legislatie.just.ro/public/DetaliiDocument/244164?) by Romania’s High Court states that profits from virtual currency transactions are taxable as “income from other sources,” requiring individuals to declare and pay income tax and health contributions. This ruling allows the National Agency for Fiscal Administration (Agenția Națională de Administrare Fiscală – ANAF) to enforce taxation on crypto gains and sets the groundwork for future regulations. Furthermore, the [2025 CARF Commitment](https://mfinante.gov.ro/en/acasa/-/asset_publisher/wald/content/angajamentul-colectiv-privind-implementarea-cadrului-de-raportare-referitor-la-crypto-active-carf-?) by the Ministry of Finance aligns Romania with the OECD’s CARF, mandating laws by 2027 for CASPs to identify clients, collect transaction data, and report it to ANAF for international sharing.

- [The Special Experimental Legal Regime (ЭПР- EPR) 2025](https://www.cbr.ru/press/event/?id=23448) proposes a legal framework for limited cryptocurrency trading by specially qualified investors. This pilot programme introduces a three-year regime allowing only individuals with assets exceeding ₽100 million or an annual income of over ₽50 million, as well as qualified institutions, to engage in crypto trading. The use of cryptocurrency for payments outside this regime is prohibited, and violations will be penalised. Outside the regime, qualified investors may access crypto-linked derivatives or digital financial assets (DFAs) but will not have access to actual cryptocurrency delivery. The primary aim of this framework is to enhance transparency and manage risks while maintaining the status of cryptocurrency as non-legal tender.

- [Federal Law No. 418-FZ of 29 November 2024](http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/document/0001202411290004?index=2) integrates digital currency into the tax system by recognising it as property. It mandates tax reporting for income from mining and trading, requires quarterly reporting by mining operators, and exempts crypto mining, sales, and certain services from VAT. Income is defined based on market value using foreign exchange data, with no revaluation of crypto holdings for tax purposes. Simplified and self-employed tax regimes for crypto activities are restricted, but documented mining expenses can be deducted. FIFO (first in, first out) or unit-based cost accounting for disposals is permitted, and violations incur a ₽40,000 fine.

- [Federal Law No. 221-FZ of 8 August 2024](https://ivo.garant.ru/) introduces mandatory registration for crypto miners and infrastructure operators, bans large-scale mining by unregistered entities, and restricts participation by individuals linked to crime or terrorism. It prohibits crypto advertising, limits digital asset access to approved investors, and allows foreign assets only if authorised and registered. Additionally, the Bank of Russia or the government can ban mining or limit energy use regionally.

- [Federal Law No. 259-FZ of 31 July 2020](http://www.kremlin.ru/acts/bank/45766/page/1) regulates DFAs and Digital Currency in Russia. It defines DFAs, designates Information System Operators (ОИС) to issue DFAs and DFA Exchange Operators to trade them, both subject to Bank of Russia registration, AML/CFT rules, and licensing. The Bank of Russia oversees compliance, [maintains registries](https://cbr.ru/admissionfinmarket/navigator/ootsfa/), and sanctions. Mining, mining pools, and infrastructure providers are legally recognised and must be registered. However, digital currency is banned as a domestic payment method, but may be used in foreign trade under special regulatory regimes. Furthermore, the law also prohibits public promotion of digital currency, enforces KYC, and allows the Bank of Russia to restrict access to foreign digital assets and regulate investor eligibility.

- [Federal Law No. 115-FZ](https://normativ.kontur.ru/document?documentId=493009&moduleId=1), enacted on 07.08.2001, is Russia’s AML/CFT law. This law has undergone various amendments up to 2025, categorising digital currency as property and integrating crypto-related activities—including issuance, exchange, and mining—into its regulatory framework. It designates crypto operators, such as DFA issuers, exchanges, and mining pool organisers, as obligated entities, requiring them to implement mandatory KYC measures, internal controls, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting. Furthermore, it empowers the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring (Rosfinmonitoring – Федеральная служба по финансовому мониторингу) to maintain blacklists of suspicious blockchain addresses, authorise wallet freezes, and enforce due diligence on crypto-related cross-border payments.

- [Law 6/2023](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2023-7053) establishes the framework for implementing the EU MiCA in Spain. It designates the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores ([CNMV](https://www.cnmv.es/portal/mica/regulacion-criptoactivos?lang=es)) as the authority responsible for supervising the issuance, offering, and admission to trading of crypto-assets that are not classified as financial instruments under MiFID II. Additionally, the Bank of Spain is assigned authority over [e-money tokens and asset-referenced tokens](https://sedeelectronica.bde.es/sede/es/aplicacion-del-reglamento-relativo-a-los-mercados-de-criptoactivos--micar--respecto-de-la-emision-de-77fc2a0eed69091.html) where applicable. The law incorporates MiCA’s definitions and service categories, outlining Spain’s sanctions regime. A [transitional period](https://www.cnmv.es/webservices/verdocumento/ver?t=%7B0f07b232-7c8e-4421-b376-c1183f80ddf2%7D) (30 December 2025) is provided for CASPs, and persons already providing crypto-related services or registered to do so in Spain before MiCA.

- Notable case: In 2025, [CMVA authorised](https://cnmv.es/Docportal/Proveedores-Servicios-Criptoactivos/Listado_ProveedoresCriptoactivos.pdf) several companies under MiCA.

- [Law 10/2010](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2010-6737) is the AML/CFT law. In 2021, it expanded its scope to include crypto-related service providers as obliged entities. This inclusion mandates compliance with all AML/CFT provisions and requires registration with the Bank of Spain. Subsequent amendments to the law introduced additional regulations, such as those concerning beneficial ownership for legal persons and trusts, along with the establishment of a national beneficial ownership register.

- [Law 35/2006 (as amended)](https://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-2006-20764) establishes the information-reporting requirements for custodians, exchanges, intermediaries, and ICO issuers. These entities are mandated to report to the Tax Administration all virtual currencies they hold in custody, as well as any acquisitions, disposals, swaps, transfers, and payments/receipts conducted in virtual currencies. The reports must include relevant details such as names, addresses, tax IDs, the class and number of coins, price, and date of transactions. Additionally, the Spanish Tax Agency provides [guidelines](https://sede.agenciatributaria.gob.es/Sede/ayuda/manuales-videos-folletos/manuales-practicos/irpf-2024/c11-ganancias-perdidas-patrimoniales/monedas-virtuales/compra-venta-monedas-virtuales-tributacion-inversor.html) regarding the taxation of cryptocurrencies.

- Sweden (EU Member)

- [Proposition 2024/25:43](https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/proposition/en-ny-eu-reglering-om-marknader-for_hc0343/html/) incorporates the EU MiCA and TFR into Swedish national law, designating the Finansinspektionen (FI) as the competent authority with the power to impose sanctions and fines, including temporary bans of up to 30 working days and permanent prohibitions on offerings and trading, while administrative fines can reach 15% of turnover or three times the profit; furthermore, the law stipulates that marketing rules for required customer information fall under the Marketing Act, meaning that information mandated by MiCA (whitepapers and customer disclosures), is considered material under this act. Thus, any missing or unclear information can trigger legal actions related to marketing law. A transition period is granted for pre-existing operators until 30 September 2025, or until a final decision is reached if they apply by 1 October 2025.

# Act 2017:630 (as amended) serves as the AML/CFT law, mandating that CASPs are obliged entities required to comply with its provisions. The law stipulates that customer due diligence must be conducted for crypto or funds transfers exceeding EUR 1,000. Additionally, it mandates enhanced checks for transfers to or from unhosted (or stand-alone) addresses. Furthermore, extra due diligence and documentation are necessary when establishing correspondent relationships with third-country institutions, which include verifying the counterparties’ authorisation or registration. The law also prohibits anonymous accounts and services.

- [Tax Guidance](https://skatteverket.se/privat/skatter/vardepapper/andratillgangar/kryptovalutor.4.15532c7b1442f256bae11b60.html?) from the Skatteverket (Tax Agency) clarifies that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are considered capital assets. As such, any sale, exchange (including crypto-to-crypto), payment for goods or services, or lending where the borrower can use the coins constitutes a taxable disposal. This must be reported on Form K4, Section D. Gains from these transactions are taxed at 30%, while losses are 70% deductible. Specific activities, such as ETH 2.0 staking rewards and mining, are taxed either as capital income or hobby/business income. Strict record-keeping is required to substantiate acquisition costs, sale prices, and wallet ownership.

- Switzerland

- [SR 958.1](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/853/de) outlines the framework for DLT-securities and DLT trading systems, defining them and applying core venue rules such as transparency and orderly trading. Authorisation is required from the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to operate, with registration occurring only after authorisation. The Swiss National Bank is involved if the infrastructure is systemically important. The framework allows for private participants and establishes rules for admission, custody, and settlement, while extending market-abuse bans to instruments on DLT venues. Additionally, the FINMA provides further [guidelines](https://www.finma.ch/en/documentation/dossier/dossier-fintech/auf-einen-blick-aufstellung-der-krypto-dienstleistungen/) for providers of crypto services.

- Notable case: In March 2025, [BX Digital AG](https://www.finma.ch/en/news/2025/03/20250318-mm-dlt-handelssystem/) was licensed by FINMA as the first DLT trading facility.

- [SR 957.1](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2009/450/de) is the Book Securities Act (BEG). It provides that when a tokenised (ledger-based) securities are credited to a securities account and held through an intermediary (custodian, central securities depository, etc.) to become an intermediated security, and thus subject to its rules for creation, transfer, collateral, and custody liability.

- [SR 958.11](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2015/854/de) specifies the application process to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority. It defines when operating a distributed ledger technology system is considered a commercial activity, triggering a ten-day notification and a sixty-day licence filing (or ninety days for adjusted filings if a small system exceeds size limits). It sets minimum capital requirements of one million or five million Swiss francs for these systems.

- [SR 220 OR](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/27/317_321_377/de) establishes the legal framework for tokenisation, creating ledger-based securities that confer full civil-law rights, including obligations for payment, transfer, pledge, resolution of lost keys, and issuer liability.

- [SR 950.1](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2019/758/de) Finanzdienstleistungsgesetz (Financial Services Act – FIDLEG) and [SR 950.11](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2019/759/de) Finanzdienstleistungsverordnung (Financial Services Ordinance – FIDLEV) provide investor protection. FIDLEG allows for a token structured as a register-based security to qualify as a security, thus falling under the standard conduct and disclosure requirements. If the tokenised security is listed on a DLT trading system, the same prospectus rules that apply in traditional venues are included in the existing investor protection framework. FIDLEV facilitates this process, and no new prospectus is required for securities already listed on another Swiss venue or DLT system. Switzerland can also recognise foreign DLT systems.

- [SR 954.1](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2018/801/de?print=true) Finanzinstitutsgesetz (Financial Institutions Act – FINIG) and [SR 954.11](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2019/763/de) Finanzinstitutsverordnung (Financial Institutions Ordinance – FINIV). FINIG outlines the firms under securities-firm supervision, mandating retail-facing firms to join an ombuds scheme. FINIV extends trade recording/reporting requirements to instruments on DLT trading systems, integrating crypto-securities services into the same supervisory framework as traditional ones.

- Swiss AML framework (AMLA/AMLO/AMLO-FINMA) classifies DLT trading facilities as financial intermediaries, subjecting them to all AML obligations, including KYC, beneficial owner identification, and reporting. Virtual currencies are treated as means of payment and payment services when assisting clients with transfers. Accepting assets, including virtual currencies, and disbursing cash or virtual currencies, or wiring value over a system, are classified as Money or Value Transfer Services (MVTS), necessitating full AML compliance. Additionally, if a single crypto transaction (or linked transactions) exceeds CHF 1,000, the customer must be identified, provided there is no money/value transfer or ongoing relationship. Anti-structuring technology is required to prevent bypassing this limit for over 30 days.

- [Tax Guidance](https://www.estv.admin.ch/estv/de/home/direkte-bundessteuer/fachinformationen-dbst/kryptowaehrungen.html) provided by the Federal Tax Administration (FTA) categorises tokens into payment, asset (debt, contract-based, equity), and utility, with distinct tax implications for holders and issuers. Holders face a wealth tax on the year-end value of tokens, while private trading gains are generally tax-free, and losses are non-deductible. Additionally, income from mining, staking, airdrops, and token wages is taxable. For issuers, debt tokens incur withholding tax and often securities transfer tax on interest. Equity-like tokens are treated as capital contributions with dividend withholding and issuance duty. Utility or contract-based tokens are taxed as revenue at issuance, typically exempt from withholding and stamp duties.

- [Law on Virtual Assets](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2074-20) (which is not yet in force) defines both secured and unsecured virtual assets and clarifies that they are not considered legal tender. It establishes the jurisdictional scope and assigns oversight to the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC), while the National Bank (NBU) is responsible for currency-backed virtual assets. Additionally, the law mandates that Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), which include custody, exchange, transfer, and intermediation services, must operate as legal entities with specific permits and minimum capital requirements. It also requires disclosures for public offers and introduces a travel rule for virtual assets and funds transfers through amendments to anti-money laundering regulations.

- [AML/CFT Act](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/main/361-20?) designates VASPs as obliged entities, requiring them to implement customer due diligence and KYC protocols. Additionally, they must report suspicious and over-the-threshold transactions, maintain records for five years or more, and conduct targeted sanctions screening and freezing. The Act incorporates the travel rule for transfers of funds and virtual assets, and assigns supervision to the Ministry of Digital Transformation.

- Cabinet Ministers Resolution No. 662 ([2023](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/662-2023-%D0%BF)) states that the Ministry of Digital Transformation supervises service providers involved in the circulation of virtual assets. It grants the Ministry the authority to conduct risk-based onsite and offsite checks, whether planned or unplanned. Furthermore, when multiple state AML supervisors oversee the same entity, they are to carry out a joint planned inspection.

- Ministry of Finance Order No. 465 ([2022](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/z0258-23)) outlines key risk indicators associated with virtual assets. These include using virtual assets in operations that lack a clear legal, tax, commercial, economic, or other lawful justification. Additionally, the use of virtual assets and anonymous payment methods, as well as transactions that appear to lack economic purpose or an apparent lawful aim, are considered red flags. Such indicators should elevate risk assessments and trigger enhanced measures.

- National Bank Resolutions [No. 65](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/v0065500-20) & [No. 107](https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/v0107500-20) of 2020 mandate that banks classify VASP-related clients as high risk. Consequently, they must implement enhanced due diligence and ongoing monitoring. Similarly, non-bank financial institutions are required to treat virtual asset activities as high risk and must implement strong AML/CFT controls.

- United Kingdom

- The Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) ([Draft Order 2025](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/680f6387faff81833fcae94b/0302425_draft_RAO_SI.pdf)) introduces and amends regulations for cryptoassets, addressing issues such as clarifying fiat-referenced stablecoins, stating that sums exchanged for these stablecoins are not considered 'deposits', outlining the safeguarding and custody requirements for qualifying cryptoassets, and tightening financial promotions by adding controlled activities related to custody, platforms, and staking, and at the same time defining what “qualifying cryptoasset” and “qualifying stablecoin,” are. The draft order also amends the AML law to require the FCA to maintain an AML register for exchange and custodian wallets only where firms are not FSMA-authorised. Additionally, authorised cryptoasset firms must notify the FCA when they act as exchange or wallet providers, as well as when they cease such activities.

- [FSMA](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/contents?), as amended, brings cryptoassets under its framework. It introduces a designated activities rule for the marketing of cryptoassets, regulating related conduct even for firms that aren't formally authorised. It establishes a framework for stablecoins, referred to as digital settlement assets (DSAs), covering issuers, custodians, and exchanges. The Act empowers the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority, and the Payment Systems Regulator to oversee key providers under a Financial Market Infrastructure type administration. Additionally, it grants the Treasury the authority to adapt the electronic money and payments law to stablecoins. Furthermore, the Act opens a sandbox for testing settlement using distributed ledger technology, delivering clearer marketing rules, enhanced consumer and system safeguards, and the flexibility to update regulations quickly.

- FSMA Order ([Financial Promotion](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2023/612/made)), as amended, brings crypto advertising under the FSMA marketing rules by establishing a qualifying cryptoasset (QCA) as a controlled investment for financial promotion purposes. To qualify as a QCA, an asset must be interchangeable and transferable; it specifically excludes electronic money, fiat currency (including digitally issued fiat), and limited-use tokens. The order allows anti-money-laundering–registered crypto exchanges and custodians to promote their own ads under strict conditions. Additionally, it extends certain exemptions, including the “sale of goods and supply of services” exemption, to QCA communications. This amendment provides the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) with clear tools to oversee these promotions.

- FSMA Order ([Regulated Activities](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2001/544?timeline=false)), as amended, outlines the criteria for what constitutes regulated investments and activities. It applies to cryptocurrencies when a token qualifies as electronic money or a security/financial instrument. Additionally, the order encompasses products that are derivatives, such as contracts for difference, which reference cryptocurrencies.

- AML/CFT Law ([as amended](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/692?)), in its [2019 amendment](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/1511/made), brought CASPs and custodian wallet providers into scope, mandating registration with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and requiring customer due diligence for crypto automated teller machine (ATM) transactions. The [2022 amendment](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2022/860/contents/made) introduced the travel rule, which mandates that sender and recipient information accompany transfers. It also requires customer due diligence on cryptoasset transfers of €1,000 or more, strengthens record-keeping practices, and mandates immediate responses to law enforcement requests and FCA reporting. Additionally, it introduced change-of-control approval for registered crypto firms. The [2023 amendment](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2023/1371/contents/made) updated the treatment of politically exposed persons, establishing a lower-risk baseline that can scale up in response to other risk factors. This amendment also outlines the supervisory role of the FCA.

- Notable case: In February 2025, in [FCA v Olumide Osunkoya](https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/olumide-osunkoya-sentenced-4-years-illegally-operating-crypto-atm-network), the defendant was convicted over unregistered crypto ATMs and failing AML checks.

- The Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act ([amended](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/56)) amends the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA). It empowers enforcement officers—including police, Revenue and Customs officers, Serious Fraud Office officers, and accredited financial investigators—to search for, seize, and detain items related to cryptoassets. The Act requires that electronic information be produced in a readable format, enabling officers to identify or access wallets. Additionally, it permits the retention, disposal, or destruction of unclaimed crypto-related items after one year.

- [Tax Guidance](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/cryptoassets-manual): According to Revenue and Customs (RC) guidance, disposals of cryptocurrency—such as selling, swapping, or spending—are usually subject to Capital Gains Tax (CGT). Tokens received from an employer, through mining or transaction confirmation, or from specific airdrops are taxed as income. Whether one’s activities qualify as trading depends on various factors, including frequency, level of organisation, and intention; if it is a trade, profits are calculated in the usual way (receipts minus allowable expenses) and taxed as trading profits. Regarding location (“situs”) rules, if a token represents an underlying asset like gold or shares, the asset’s location is used. If there is no underlying asset, RC considers the token to be located where the beneficial owner resides.

- Vatican City

- The AML/CFT Law is based on [Legge n. XVIII (2013)](https://www.asif.va/ITA/pdf/Legge_n.XVIII.pdf), which was later amended by [Legge n. CCXLVII (2018)](https://www.vaticanstate.va/phocadownload/leggi-decreti/normativa-penale/N.%20CCXLVIILegge_recante_modifiche_alla_LeggeN.XVIII.pdf) to explicitly prohibit the provision of crypto, virtual, and synthetic currency services. Further amendments were made with [Legge n. DCXIV (2023)](https://www.vaticanstate.va/phocadownload/leggi-decreti/documenti-prevenzione/N.%20DCXIV.pdf), which introduced detailed definitions for crypto/e-money/virtual/synthetic currency and expanded the scope of AML measures to include digital and electronic value, as well as Money Value Transfer Services (MVTS), but it still maintained the existing ban.

Conclusion

The regulatory frameworks governing blockchain-related activities in Europe are dynamic, comprising harmonised EU regulations and distinct national approaches that are constantly evolving. This article illustrates how a region comprising 46 countries strives to balance the technological innovation of blockchain with the necessary oversight. It outlines the current regulatory landscape and highlights the crucial roles of organisations such as the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), along with various national supervisory authorities, in shaping the future of digital finance.

As we move forward, the emphasis shifts from merely understanding the existing rules to considering their enforcement. Some countries have demonstrated practical implementation of these laws through legal cases, sanctions, and licensing, as showcased in this article. The next instalment of this series will explore the regulatory outlook of another key region. What is evident is that the global regulatory picture for blockchain-related activities is just beginning to take shape, and the story is far from over.
