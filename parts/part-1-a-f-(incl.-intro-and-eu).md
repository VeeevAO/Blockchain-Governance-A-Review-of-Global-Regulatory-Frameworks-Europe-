#### Blockchain Governance: A Review of Global Regulatory Frameworks (Europe)

Introduction

Europe’s cryptocurrency regulations extend beyond the borders of the European Union (EU). This article examines 46 countries (the 44 UN members in Europe, plus Kosovo and the Vatican City) to illustrate how the region regulates blockchain in practice. Within the EU, frameworks such as the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), the Travel Rule, and various other Directives and Guidelines create a harmonised regulatory environment. Some EU member states even went a step further to introduce criminal sanctions to bolster compliance.

In contrast, significant markets like the UK and Switzerland, along with numerous European Economic Area (EEA) states, neighbouring countries, and microstates, operate under distinct regulatory frameworks, each with unique timelines, permissions, and enforcement styles. As the second part of this series, this article builds on the North America article, employing the same template (laws, guidelines, licensing, cases, enforcement). This structure allows for a direct comparison of jurisdictions, facilitating informed planning for any cross-border or inter-jurisdictional activities.

- The European Union (EU)

- The [Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1114/oj) (MiCA) 2023/1114 establishes uniform rules for crypto-assets and related services and activities within the EU. Some provisions of MiCA include definitions for essential terms and concepts, such as the scope of what is a “crypto-asset service”, mandates Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs) to be authorised before operating (Title V stipulates the grounds for authorisation and withdrawal, and conditions of operating), specifies rules for crypto-asset White Paper, Consumer Protection, and Stable Coins (referred to as asset-referenced & electronic money tokens. The Regulation does not apply to crypto-assets that are unique and not fungible with other crypto-assets, such as digital art and collectibles.

- [Regulation (EU) 2023/1113](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32023R1113) (Transfer of Funds Regulation - TFR), also known as the “Travel Rule”, amends [Directive (EU) 2015/849](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2015/849/oj/eng)[The Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism EU Directive (AML/CFT)], expands the rules governing the transfer of funds to include crypto-assets and requires the inclusion of payer/payee or originator/beneficiary details during transfer of funds or crypto-assets. Chapter III of the Regulation outlines all obligations that CASPs must follow during the transfer transactions.

- European Banking Authority (EBA) Guidelines

- [EBA/GL/2024/11](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-07/6de6e9b9-0ed9-49cd-985d-c0834b5b4356/Travel%20Rule%20Guidelines.pdf), also known as the “Travel Rule Guidelines,” clarifies the steps Payment Service Providers (PSPs), CASPs, and their Intermediaries should take to detect missing or incomplete information that accompanies a transfer of funds or crypto-assets, and the procedures they should put in place to manage a situation where a transfer is lacking the required information.

- [EBA/GL/2024/01](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/a3e89f4f-fbf3-4bd6-9e07-35f3243555b3/Final%20Amending%20%20Guidelines%20on%20MLTF%20Risk%20Factors.pdf) amends ML/TF Risk-Factors Guidelines ([EBA/GL/2021/02](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document_library/Publications/Guidelines/2021/963637/Final%20Report%20on%20Guidelines%20on%20revised%20ML%20TF%20Risk%20Factors.pdf)), extending the AML risk-factor guidelines to crypto-assets and CASPs. It also introduces crypto-specific risk factors and measures to combat them, such as CASPs having suitable and effective transaction monitoring and analytical tools, as well as applying enhanced customer due diligence (CDD).

- The Directive on Administrative Cooperation ([DAC8](https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/taxation/tax-transparency-cooperation/administrative-co-operation-and-mutual-assistance/directive-administrative-cooperation-dac/dac8_en)) is an [EU Council Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32023L2226) based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework ([OECD-CARF](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/tax-transparency-and-international-co-operation.html)). It mandates the automatic exchange of information on crypto-assets between EU countries to combat tax fraud, evasion, and avoidance. Reporting CryptoAsset Service Providers (RCASPs) are also subject to reporting requirements and due diligence procedures. This Directive will become applicable across all EU Countries by 1 January 2026.

- [Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/299](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2025/299/oj/eng) of 31 October 2024 supplements the EU MiCA, setting regulatory technical standards requiring crypto-asset service providers to keep proportionate, management-approved, and annually tested business-continuity policies and plans—covering governance, timely client/authority communications, etc., to ensure continuity and regularity of services.

- [The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) Guidelines (2025)](https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica) cover the following key areas:

- Maintaining secure systems and access controls for crypto-services.

- Establishing rules for crypto-asset transfer services.

- Clarifying reverse solicitation from third-country firms.

- Defining suitability and periodic statement requirements for portfolio management.

- Guiding the prevention and detection of crypto market abuse.

- Establishing minimum knowledge and competence standards for staff.

- Regulation 2022/858 of 30 May 2022 ([the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv%3AOJ.L_.2022.151.01.0001.01.ENG&toc=OJ%3AL%3A2022%3A151%3ATOC)) establishes a time-limited EU pilot for market infrastructures based on distributed ledger technology (DLT), which includes DLT multilateral trading facilities, DLT settlement systems, and combined DLT trading and settlement systems. These infrastructures can trade and settle tokenised financial instruments under the oversight of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). The pilot allows for targeted, conditional exemptions from several regulations, including the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR, Regulation (EU) No 600/2014), the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II, Directive 2014/65/EU), and the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR, Regulation (EU) No 909/2014). Eligibility is limited to shares of issuers with a market capitalisation under €500 million, bonds and money-market instruments with issue sizes under €1 billion, and units in collective investment undertakings with assets under management under €500 million. Additionally, there is an aggregate cap of €6 billion per infrastructure and a €9 billion threshold that triggers transition off the pilot.

- Albania

- [Law No. 66/2020](https://amf.gov.al/pdf/ligje/LawNo_66_2020ONFINANCIALMARKETSBASEDONDISTRIBUTEDLEDGERTECHNOLOGY.pdf?), enacted in 2020, is Albania’s first regulation governing cryptocurrencies. It governs financial market activities based on distributed ledger technology (DLT), requires Virtual Assets Service Providers (VASPs) to obtain a license before operating, and mandates compliance with all Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) obligations. The Albanian Financial Supervisory Authority (AFSA) and the National Authority on Information Society (NAIS) are responsible for administration. The [AFSA](https://amf.gov.al/licencimi_rregullimi.asp) provides the procedures for obtaining a licence.

- Notable case: In 2022, [two crypto mining farms](https://asp.gov.al/policia-e-shtetit-finalizohet-operacioni-policor-i-koduar-kriptofarm/) were shut down, and the perpetrators were arrested for failing to comply with provisions of the law.

- Andorra

- Decrees [211/2023](https://bopadocuments.blob.core.windows.net/bopa-documents/035065/pdf/GR20230515_08_58_08.pdf) & [213/2023](https://bopadocuments.blob.core.windows.net/bopa-documents/035065/pdf/GR20230515_08_59_57.pdf) were both issued in May 2023 and form part of the government of Andorra’s strategy to promote digital innovation and the digital economy. They promote fintech research and development through a controlled testing environment known as a “sandbox” and establish the framework for registering and operating innovative start-ups.

- [Digital Assets Act](https://www.portaljuridicandorra.ad/L2022024) (Law 24/2022) recognises blockchain and digital assets, granting them legal value in the form of cryptocurrency. It requires VASPs to be licensed and implement AML/CFT obligations, including the traceability of transactions and the maintenance of records for 10 years. The overseeing authority is the Andorran Financial Authority.

- [Decree 478/2022](https://bopadocuments.blob.core.windows.net/bopa-documents/034139/pdf/GD20221125_08_49_08.pdf) establishes the regulatory framework for licensing and supervising persons dealing with digital assets and distributed ledger technology (DLT) Exchanges. It mandates all entities in the digital assets space to comply with all AML/CFT policies.

- [Law 9/2021](https://www.portaljuridicandorra.ad/L2021009) amends [Law 35/2014](https://bopadocuments.blob.core.windows.net/bopa-documents/026071/pdf/lo26071011.pdf) on electronic trust services to include trust services on the DLT.

It granted the Securities Commission (SC) the authority to register VASPs, supervise them for AML/CFT compliance, and impose penalties.

- Notable case: [Balkan Crypto Exchange (BCX)](https://bcx.ba/en/component/content/article?Itemid=161&id=131%3Abcx-platform-registered-as-the-first-provider-of-services-related-to-virtual-currencies-with-the-securities-commission-of-the-rs&) is the first VASP registered under this law with the SC.

- Bulgaria (EU Member)

- The EU MiCA: As a member of the EU, Bulgaria transposed the regulation into its [national law](https://www.bta.bg/en/news/economy/914964-parliament-adopts-crypto-asset-market-regulation-bill?) in June 2025. CASPs in Bulgaria are expected to comply with the provisions by [31 December 2025](https://www.bta.bg/en/news/bulgaria/891474-markets-in-crypto-assets-bill-adopted-on-first-reading?).

- The Prevention and Suppression of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Law of 2007 ([as amended in 2021](https://www.centralbank.cy/images/media/pdf/The-Prevention-and-Suppression-of-Money-Laundering-Laws-of-2007-2021-unofficial-consolidation.pdf?)) provides a comprehensive AML/CFT framework. It defines CASPs and subjects them to the same AML/CFT obligations as other financial institutions. The Securities and Exchange Commission maintains an [official register](https://www.cysec.gov.cy/en-GB/entities/crypto-asset-services-providers-casps/casp-register/) of CASPs under this law. This register lists entities that are legally authorised to offer crypto-asset services in or from Cyprus.

- Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) Circulars: CySEC has issued [several circulars](https://www.cysec.gov.cy/en-GB/public-info/circulars/supervised/casp-circulars/) on CASPs, providing essential guidance on the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in Cyprus.

Meanwhile, [a new crypto-asset taxation law](https://skm.dk/aktuelt/presse-nyheder/nyheder/lovforslag-om-beskatning-af-kryptoaktiver-udskydes) is being proposed, which will clarify the tax rules. Recommendations published by the Tax Council in an October 2024 [Report](https://skm.dk/ministeriet/om-skatteministeriet/publikationer-fra-skattelovraadet/rapport-om-finansielle-kryptoaktiver) are proposed to be the basis for this new law.

- Notable cases: [Cases BS-32180/2021-HJR & BS-17439/2022-HJR](https://www.domstol.dk/hoejesteret/aktuelt/2023/3/beskatning-af-fortjeneste-ved-salg-af-bitcoins/), in both cases, the court held that profits from cryptocurrency mining and subsequent sales are subject to taxation, regardless of acquisition method (purchase, mining, or donation), subject to narrow speculation exemptions.

- Estonia (EU Member)

- [Market in Crypto-Assets Act (2024)](https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/519092024001/consolide?) implements the EU MiCA and Digital Operations Resilience Act ([DORA](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2022/2554/oj/eng)) in Estonia’s national law. Finantsinspektsioon (Financial Supervisory Authority) is the designated supervisory authority.

- [Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Act (2017)](https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/517112017003/consolide) subjects VASPs to AML/CFT obligations. It provided the framework for licensing of VASPs in Estonia before the EU MiCA and granted supervisory and licensing authority to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). The [FIU has published several guidelines](https://fiu.ee/en/guidelines-fiu/guidelines?) on virtual asset-related activities.

- Notable case: [B2BX Digital Exchange OÜ](https://fiu.ee/en/news/b2bx-digital-exchange-ou-renounced-their-license-virtual-asset-services-during-supervision?), facing licence revocation from the FIU after significant deficiencies were found in its operations, voluntarily relinquished its license on January 31, 2025.

- Finland (EU Member)

- [Bill No. T/11922](https://www.parlament.hu/irom42/11922/11922-0013.pdf) (June 2025) amends several Hungarian laws, including the [Criminal Code](https://net.jogtar.hu/jogszabaly?docid=a1200100.tv) (2012. évi C. törvény), to enhance the competitiveness of Hungary. These amendments criminalise the abuse of crypto-assets and the unauthorised provision of crypto-asset exchange services. Under the new legislation, users of unauthorised crypto exchanges—those that are not validated or licensed—who convert crypto-assets into fiat or other crypto-assets face penalties of 2 to 5 years imprisonment. Similarly, unauthorised service providers (CASPs) can be punished with imprisonment ranging from 3 to 8 years. The length of the prison sentence is determined by the financial threshold involved in the offence. For example, a basic offence involving any unauthorised crypto exchange, irrespective of the value, can result in up to 3 years in prison. In contrast, a very high-value offence involving amounts of HUF 500 million or more could lead to a maximum of 8 years imprisonment.

- Notable case: In response to this law, [Revolut](https://help.revolut.com/hu-HU/help/crypto/question-crypto-hungary-pausing-services-retail/) paused its crypto services in Hungary in July 2025.
